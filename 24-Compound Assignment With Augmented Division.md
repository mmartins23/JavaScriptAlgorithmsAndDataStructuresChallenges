# Compound Assignment With Augmented Division
The /= operator divides a variable by another number.

```js
myVar = myVar / 5;
```

Will divide myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

```js
myVar /= 5;
```

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the /= operator.

### Answer

```js
let a = 48;
let b = 108;
let c = 33;

// Only change code below this line
a /= 12;
b /= 4;
c /= 11;
```
