# Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction
Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

```js
myVar = myVar - 5;
```

will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

```js
myVar -= 5;
```

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.

### Answer

```js
let a = 11;
let b = 9;
let c = 3;

// Only change code below this line
a -= 6;
b -= 15;
c -= 1;
```
