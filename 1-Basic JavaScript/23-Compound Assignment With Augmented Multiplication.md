# Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication
The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.

```js
myVar = myVar * 5;
```
will multiply myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

```js
myVar *= 5;
```

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator.

### Answer

```js
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;
```
